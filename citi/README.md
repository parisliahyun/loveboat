* This is my first app for General Assembly NYC built during the week of October 21st - October 25th, 2013. 
* The Awesome Citi app is meant to help Citibike commuters find stations that have available bikes and docks nearest to a given address. 
* The app uses the Geocoder gem and the Citibikenyc gem to pinpoint searched addresses and return real time data on citibike availabilities for all stations throughout the city. 
* The algorithm will return the address of the station and number of bikes and docks that are available at that station. If one of those values is zero, the algorithm will provide two addresses -- one for the nearest station with available bikes and one for the nearest station with available docks. 
* The search will also return the next closest station as an alternative.
* The user can save as many destinations as they'd like to their account. 
* It seems there are a few stations throughout the city that are non-operational. The app user will need to be up on the latest information on non-operational stations.
* Awesome Citi is on Twitter! @awesomeciti
* I'd love to hear suggestions from New Yorkers on what I should build next onto this app. Please feel free to follow and DM on Twitter. Happy biking!
